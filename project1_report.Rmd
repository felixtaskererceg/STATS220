## Project requirements

To meet the requirements regarding GitHub, I wrote about *why* I chose
this course as well as important information that someone may want to
know about the course.

This important information includes: 

- Link to course outline. 
- Percentage obtained from each task within the course. 
- Capabilities
developed within the course. 
- A short blurb explaining the purpose of
the repo.

I carefully followed the criteria of the assignment, making sure to hit the key points I have to use as well as personal touch and creativity. I struggled with timing but it led to me making a final product that is much better than I originally created. I used a already existing meme based on a statistical joke and improved on it considerably.

## My meme

```{r meme-code, eval=TRUE}
library(magick)

#I have selected a statistics meme that uses wordplay and the film Mean Girls. 

#First Image

  image_scale(500)

#Square adjacent first image
meme_text1 <- image_blank(width = 300, 
                          height = 280, 
                          color = "#FF69B4") %>%
  image_annotate(text = "Average people \n can...",
                 color = "#FFFFFF",
                 size = 40,
                 font = "Impact",
                 gravity = "Center")

# putting the frames in order using a vector
frames <- c(frame0, frame1, frame2, frame3, frame4, frame5, frame6, frame7, frame8, frame9, frame10)

# creating an animation
image_animate(frames, fps = 5)


```

## Creativity

![meme_gif](my_meme.gif)

For creativity, I wanted to explore the effects and possible applications of the animation function in the magick package.

To do this I first experimented will alternating the colors of the text in the meme. However, this change to no create the effect I desired. To account for this I upped the amount of frames I had from 4 to 11, to give me more room to work with on the gif. Ultimately I felt that changing the colors too much was not pleasing to eye. So I returned the color change back to a simple flip between white and hot-pink on every second frame.

The added benefit of this change though was I got to more smoothly demonstrate the expression of the "mean girl" in the gif. This made for a much better effect in my opinion.


Another creative factor I employed was the clean use of sub-headings and emojis in the GitHub page.


## Learning reflection

The important ideas I learned from this initial section of STATS 220 are actually more organisational and assumptive learnings that I have taken away.

I made the intense initial error of assuming my prior knowledge of code would help me complete the project in a shorter planned time. However, as I biased other assignment due to this self imposed false confidence - I left it too late and drastically underestimated my skill set in a different language. 

Besides that... I really enjoyed working with images in a coding language. It is something completely new to me and seems like such a valid and useful skill.
