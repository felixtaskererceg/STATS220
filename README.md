# Statistics Projects

This repository contains RMarkdown reports from several data analysis projects completed as part of STAT220. Each report is rendered as an interactive HTML file and can be viewed online via GitHub Pages.

### What is the purpose of this repo? :computer:
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate and save the work I have done for the paper of STATS 220. Throughout the semester, we will have many projects to complete, and this repo will act as a way to display such projects.

According to the [University of Auckland course outline page](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213), this course: "Explores the processes of data acquisition, data storage and data processing using current computer technologies."

### Why *this* course :man_shrugging:

I selected this course for a number of reasons. Having taken both Computer Science and Statistics papers, I feel this course accurately caters to both interests while exploring a new topic for me.

Further, having taken a communications paper that focused on the ethical practices of data, I was more than curious to apply this critical and ethical thinking about the topic to a course that involved my primary major, Computer Science.

Using a language outside of Python was a big appealing factor also, as Python is the primary coding language in employed earlier-stage Computer Science Courses). I believe building the skills in another language will enable me to become a more versatile and experinced computer scientist in the extremely important field of statistics.

### Capabilities Developed in this Course :pencil2:

As with each University of Auckland, there is a core set of capabilities aimed to be developed over the length of the course, these are:


1.	Disciplinary Knowledge and Practice :timer_clock:
3.	Critical Thinking :brain:
5.	Solution Seeking :thinking:
6.	Communication and Engagement :loudspeaker:
7.	Independence and Integrity :scroll:
