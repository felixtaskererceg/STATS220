# **STATS220** - *Semester 1 2024* :books:
### What is the purpose of this repo? :computer:
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate and save the work I have done for the paper of STATS 220. Throughout the semester, we will have many projects to complete, and this repo will act as a way to display such projects.

According to the [University of Auckland course outline page](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213), this course: "Explores the processes of data acquisition, data storage and data processing using current computer technologies."

### Why *this* course :man_shrugging:

I selected this course for a number of reasons. Having taken both Computer Science and Statistics papers, I feel this course accurately caters to both interests while exploring a new topic for me.

Further, having taken a communications paper that focused on the ethical practices of data, I was more than curious to apply this critical and ethical thinking about the topic to a course that involved my primary major, Computer Science.

Using a language outside of Python was a big appealing factor also, as Python is the primary coding language in employed earlier-stage Computer Science Courses). I believe building the skills in another language will enable me to become a more versatile and experinced computer scientist in the extremely important field of statistics.

### Capabilities Developed in this Course :pencil2:
