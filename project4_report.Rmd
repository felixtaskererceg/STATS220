## Introduction
#### Why I chose these channels...
I chose these two YouTube channels as I wanted to explore channels I watch myself. I also wanted the channels to be similar in production so I could analyse how possible choices they make that are present in the data may affect the channel as a whole. This is because if the channels produced completely different topics, the insights I found in the data may be due to the topic and viewers. Basically I believed it would be more isolated.

#### My two ideas before creating the visualisations...
One thing that heavily interested me before going in (for some reason), was if there was any correlation between the length of a title of a video and the length of the video overall. My question was - "Would a longer titled video need more time to explain the topic the title described?". The second interest I had was seeing the relationship of likes and views across both channels. Before visualisations I saw that Kurzgesagt seemed to have many more likes per video than Vox seemed to. I considered adding another data point to the data collected in the sheet. The data point would be if the creator of the video asked the user to like the video -  but this would mean I would have had to have watced the 200 videos in my data set. Which is simply not feasible.

#### My process for creating the visualisations...
The process for these visualisations was long. This topic really intrigued me - so I wanted to keep adding visualisations to the R folder to see if I could observe or find anything else interesting in the data. This meant I often built on other plots I had already created. For example, I created a dot plot charting the view to like ratio of a video for each channel. I noticed a steeper correlation for Kurzgesagt, which led me to wonder if I summed both variables, would this steeper correlation be quite strong. I chose the variation in chart types as I believed that would give me the best insight into the data. I tried to compare a whole bunch of variables that didnt work too. Often this was due to not knowing how to solve a coding problem. But one case is the relationship between the title length and video length - this did not turn out how I expected, so I changed it to a dot plot. 

## Dynamic data story
#### My dynamic data story...

#### How my dynamic data story demonstrates creativity...
I really enjoy visual design. So this new, more solid and viscous way of creating a visually pleasing page was a great challenge. I themed the whole story around a retro/70's theme. This required an insane amount of time adjusting small images using image_composite() and the offset argument of the magick package funtion. The retro theme matched the custom theme I downloaded for the plot after doing research to find one that matched the image I had in my head. Further, I included a piece of retro tech in the corner of each image for visuals, as well as a retro page splitter to make a more seamless section between the page of text and the graphs. I am very proud of what I produced. It took many hours. I also went above and beyond with the number of plots as I really enjoyed exploring the data in this project. 

Also, REMOVING THE BACKGROUNDS OF ALL THE IMAGES SO IT WOULDNT LOOK AWFUL AFTER COMPOSITE. This probably took the most time, until I found a website that did it automatically... (big sigh).


## Learning reflection
#### One important idea I learned from module 4B...
4B has been my favorite module so far. I feel like I can fully manage and manipulate data for the visualisations now. The takeaway I enjoyed the most was the ordering of data we focused on in the task. I found this very exciting and it was great to implement into my project. 
I also have to acknowledge that I finally got my time management correct (barely).

#### Things I want to explore further... 
I am very excited to explore further design elements in languages that can analyse data. I find that without visual support, data often bores people, which I find a shame. I think with good presentation we can inform those interested on a topic even better than if it was presented bare bones. It's like putting cheese sauce on broccoli - only makes it better in my opinion.

#### Things I taught myslef...
I really wanted to make the sides of the graphs present nicely and not have scientific notation - so I used the scale package to make sure it was presented well. I also used a theme that I researched so it would match the retro theme I had in my head. I also had to learn how to tilt the text, as the words in the top 10 overlapped.
